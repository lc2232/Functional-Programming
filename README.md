# Functional Programming 2020/21

This repo is for my Functional Programming unit that I took in my second year at university.

This unit is where I learnt about Haskell and the Lambda Calculus

The coursework involved writing a lambda caclulus evaluator in Haskell

The tutorial directory contains some example of my learning throughout the unit.
